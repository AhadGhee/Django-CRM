#Anytime you in Django you want to create a new homepage (About, contact, etc.), It is a three step process
#1. create actual template file
#2. Create the html page
#3. Create a URL 
#4. Create a view

#View - A view in Django is just a Python function (or class) that receives a request and returns a response.
#Template File - A template is just an HTML file stored in your projectâ€™s templates/ folder.
#Template = HTML file, View = Python code to load it, URL = web address to reach it.

    path('', views.home, name='home'),
   # path('login/', views.login_user, name='login'),
    path('logout/', views.logout_user, name='logout'),  
    # it is called login_user bc login is a function we imported
    path('register/', views.register_user, name='register')
